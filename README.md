## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for JavaScript-based systems)
- MongoDB or MySQL (for database management)
- npm or yarn (for package management)
- Git (for version control)

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/library-management-system.git
    cd library-management-system
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    If you're using Node.js, install the necessary dependencies with npm or yarn:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Configure Database**
    - Create a MongoDB or MySQL database and add your database credentials in the `.env` or configuration file.
    - Example for MongoDB (`.env`):
      ```env
      DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/libraryDB
      ```
    - Example for MySQL (`.env`):
      ```env
      DB_HOST=localhost
      DB_USER=root
      DB_PASSWORD=password
      DB_NAME=libraryDB
      ```

4. **Start the Application**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    This will start the server and host the library management system on a local development server (usually `http://localhost:3000`).
